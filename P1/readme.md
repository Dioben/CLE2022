# PROJECT 1 NOTES

FIXED NUMBER OF THREAD PARAM

main gets the params, starts a worker, prints worker results

monitors seem relevant

final folder structure:
CLE1_T$G# - > prog1/ prog2/ report.pdf

report is powerpoint type, up to 6 pages

add comments to stuff

for text each file is a job
for matrix stuff both file decomposition and determinant calculus is a job
maybe make it so workers can do both things

compile with `gcc main.c sharedRegion.c worker.c -Wall -lpthread -lm`
